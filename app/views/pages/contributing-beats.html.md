## MIDI Programs

### [Aria Maestosa](http://ariamaestosa.sourceforge.net)
Simple MIDI sequencer, cross-platform, open source. Easy to use, supports MIDI drums, but not much tablature support.

### [Guitar Pro](http://www.guitar-pro.com)
Tablature program, cross-platform, proprietary($$$). Pretty easy to use, great tablature editing, but pricy and not the most standard-compliant MIDI exports.

### [MuseScore](https://musescore.org)
Advanced scorewriter, cross-platform, open source. Lots of features but hard to get a handle on.
